# What is gacha?
 is a video game that implements the gacha (toy vending machine) mechanic. Similar to loot boxes, gacha games entice players to spend in-game currency to receive a random in-game item. Some in-game currency generally can be gained through game play, and some by purchasing it from the game publisher using real-world funds.

Most implementors of the Gacha model are free-to-play (F2P) mobile games.

The gacha game model began to be widely used in the early 2010s, particularly in Japan. Most of the highest-grossing mobile games in Japan use it, and it has become an integral part of Japanese mobile game culture. The game mechanism is also increasingly used in Chinese and Korean games, as well as Western games. Despite their ubiquity, gacha games have been criticized for being addictive, and are often compared to gambling due to the incentive to spend real-world money on chance-based rewards.

#How does this code work?
The principle of operation is very simple, that is, when entering a number, the system will be randomized according to the number of times entered. It will randomly be a number from 1 to 100 and then randomize the array inside again. But there are special cases or guarantees added.
